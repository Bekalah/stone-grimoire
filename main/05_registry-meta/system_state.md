*A living repair & update ledger for the Cathedral of Circuits.*

—

## Core Instructions (as of 2025-08-24)
- **Engines Integration**  
  - `structure.json` = single truth.  
  - `cathedral-engine.js` reads → applies stylepack, overlays, tones.  
  - `room-plaque.js` = curator voice.  
  - `alchemy-engine.js` = fusion ops.  
  - `angels72_enriched.json` now present in `/assets/data/angels/`.  

- **Sponsor Brief**  
  Repo framed as museum-grade, ND-safe, fusion-engine cathedral.  
  Status: framework complete → next = cymatic mandalas, planetary cycles, PD engravings.  

- **Thelemic Alignment**  
  Triad motto math (99 + 93 + 2 = 8).  
  Archetype ledger: Moonchild, Ann Abyss, IGNI, Gemini, Virelai Ezra Lux, Zidaryen, Bea, Mirror Witch.  

- **Integration Brief**  
  Confirms portability: stylepacks, cathedral engine, plaques, angelic data, alchemy engine, labs, ND-friendly standards.

## Standards to Maintain
- **Sound:** cathedral impulse reverb, organ-depth bass, no flat sine.  
- **Visuals:** no flat icons; depth, glaze, reflection.  
- **Atmosphere:** planetary light cycles, breath-motion.  
- **Accuracy:** Rosslyn carvings, Pythagorean harmonics, Solfeggio.  
- **Accessibility:** tone → cymatic bloom, step → narrated glyph.

## Registry / Changelog
- 📜 Archive: `seals/compass.svg`  
- ✨ Consecrate: `assets/data/geometry/compass.svg`  
  *Reason: consolidate all scaffolds under `/assets/data/geometry/`.*  

- 🔮 Refine: `structure.json` route → `main/thelemic-alignment-brief.html`  
  *Reason: lowercase, hyphenated, web-safe path; prevents iPad/git case bugs.*
