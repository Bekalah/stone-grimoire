# 🜍 Stone Grimoire — Update Summary

This file tracks the **living progress** of Codex 144:99 (Cathedral of Circuits).  
Each entry is sponsor-grade, museum-grade, and curator-ready.

## ✦ 3) What We’ve Built So Far

### Framework
- **Style Wardrobe** → `assets/data/stylepacks.json` + `assets/js/core/style-engine.js`  
  Museum-quality palettes & motifs (Hilma spirals, Solfeggio ribbons, Gothic tracery).
- **Structure.json** → `assets/data/structure.json`  
  Single source of truth for all rooms.
- **Plaques** → `assets/js/components/room-plaque.js`  
  Every page carries a curator card (glyph, tone, swatches, notes).
- **ND-Friendly Sound Engine** → `assets/js/engines/ambient-engine.js`  
  WebAudio with Solfeggio & Pythagorean tones, cathedral IR reverb, EQ + limiter.  
  No autoplay, no strobe.

### Realms & Modules
- **Cathedral Nave** — twin pillars + apprentice spiral; Jacob’s Ladder expansion.  
- **Chapels** — Apprentice, Lady Chapel (Shekinah focus), Crypt (Saturn/Binah), Musical Cubes labs, Angel Lab.  
- **Temple Realm (Hilma 5)** — immersive visionary art space styled after Hilma af Klint & *The Five* (spirals, faery overlays, fractal cosmogenesis).  
- **Shem Ladder** — 72 angelic archetypes (tones, decans, stylepacks) → interactive reskinning of the cathedral.  
- **Helix Totem** — fusion lab where archetypes blend (color glides, sound morphs, alchemical operations).  
- **Graphics Layer** → fractals, halos, ribbons, Platonic solids, PD mandalas.

### Standards & Provenance
- **Provenance Blocks** — all data files now carry license, lineage, curator, date.  
- **Schemas** — `assets/data/structure.schema.json`, `assets/data/stylepacks.schema.json` → validation + IDE autocomplete.  
- **Museum-Grade Rubric** — cosmology, rites, diagrams, poetry, artifact feel fully integrated.

## ✦ 4) Next Expansions (Planned)

- **Cymatic Mandalas** — bloom on tone strike.  
- **Planetary-Hour Tint Cycles** — Sun → Saturn overlays.  
- **PD Engravings + Manifest** — sponsor safety for art assets.  
- **Crystal Grid Fractals** — Reiki / SEKEM / chi integration.  
- **Green Man Vine Fractals** — faery shadows, ND-friendly.

## ✦ 5) Sponsor & Team Summary

We now hold a **living cathedral framework**:  
- Every page styled by data.  
- Every chamber explained by plaques.  
- Every sound ND-safe and cathedral-true.  

The system is **modular, accessible, and sponsor-ready**.  
The only blocker noted previously — **folio folder conflicts** — has been resolved by consolidating all folio records under `/folios/`.  

⚜️ From here: expand into full nave (Boaz, Jachin, Apprentice), layer in cymatics + planetary hours, and continue building museum-grade, fusion-true.
