## üî± Evolutionary Astrology

Following Jeffrey Wolf Green‚Äôs school, the Cathedral encodes:
- Pluto = soul desire
- South Node (Ketu) = karmic residue
- North Node (Rahu) = hunger for growth

Pluto in Scorpio, 5th house, is the root of my Cathedral: survival through creative sovereignty.

## üåë The Geometry of Evolution

- Octagram ‚Äî the master wheel of balance, mediating square (matter) and circle (spirit).
- Tesseract ‚Äî fourth-dimensional cube, architecture of simultaneity.

Together they bind the repos:
- Circuitum99 (Soul, 33 spine)
- Cosmogenesis Learning Engine (Mind, 144 spiral, 99 gates)
- Stone-Grimoire (Body, 243 completion)
- Liber Arcanae (Companion, 78 Tarot nodes with Tara overlays)

## üî¢ Numerology as Cathedral Spine

The Cathedral rests on spiral constants:
- 21 pillars (Fibonacci, Tarot + 21 Taras)
- 33 spine (vertebrae, initiations)
- 72 Shem angels/demons (lunar decans)
- 78 archetypes (Tarot continuum)
- 99 gates (3 √ó 33, recursive expansion)
- 144 lattice (8th Fibonacci, Codex matrix)
- 243 completion (3‚Åµ, cube of balance)

## üúè Research Canon

Grounded texts and archives: Dee, Agrippa, Splendor Solis, Case, Fortune, Regardie, Mat√©, Falconer, Levy.
The Cathedral is ND-safe: no strobe, gentle tone defaults, consecrated by angelic banishing overlays.
