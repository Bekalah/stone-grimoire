PRIME LAW
- ND-safe; never flat; offline-first; no workflows; no lore overwrites
FIRST REPLY MUST INCLUDE
1) echo of goal + repos + exact paths
2) 5-step plan with filenames
3) mapping table (if alignment)
4) quote Definition of Done + how you'll verify
DEFINITION OF DONE
- no CI/CD, no Pillow, no animation, no flat SVG
- deliverables as one iPad-safe block, ASCII quotes, LF
- registry.md + structure.json align; integrity-check.mjs runs green
- ND-safe comments included; change report lists files/keys added
