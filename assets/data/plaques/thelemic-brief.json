  "what": "A numerical and doctrinal spine for Codex 144:99, aligning the Cathedral to method-over-dogma practice.",
  "why": "To keep the work rigorous, testable, and artist-safe: numbers as living archetypes; vows as practice, not pose.",
  "how": "Enter calmly. Read the brief. Reflect on 99 · 93 · 2 → 8 (∞) and how the current session embodies it. Close with breath and 'License to Depart.'",
  "notes": "UI mirrors banish → work → depart rhythm. Keep lore explanatory, not gatekeeping.",
