## Role in the Trinity  
**Stone Grimoire** is the **Body** of the Trinity.  
It is the archive: grimoires, folios, visionary plates, provenance intact.  
Here the **walls of the Cathedral** rise — carved with seals, sigils, and memory.

## Shared Data Contracts  
- avatars_tarot.json  
- spine33.json  
- angels72.json  
- stylepacks.json  
- liber777_correspondences.json  
- library_index.json  

Every artifact carries provenance: title, author, year, edition, license.

## Engines  
- curator-engine.js (plaque & provenance system)  
- archive-engine.js (folio access)  
- relief-mesh.js (embossed diagrams)  

—

## Standards  
- **Museum-grade**: plates digitized at archival quality.  
- **ND-safe**: calm access, no flashing; reduced-motion aware.  
- **Trauma-informed**: symbols contextualized, not weaponized.  
- **Continuity**: every entry indexed to codex and cosmos.  

—

## Scientific Anchors  
- Preservation follows archival best practices (OA museums, Wikimedia, Met Museum).  
- Supports spiral pedagogy: archives feed into Cosmogenesis chambers.  
- Trauma pedagogy principle: learners may engage symbolically without pressure.  

—

## Place in the Trinity  
- **Stone Grimoire = Body**  
- **circuitum99 = Soul**  
- **Cosmogenesis Engine = Spirit**  

Together: **Cathedral of Circuits**.

## Numerology Spiral Grammar
Harmonic checkpoints guide the Cathedral’s design:
- **21 pillars** — Fibonacci resonance (8 + 13), aligned to Tarot majors and 21 Taras.
- **33 spine** — threefold master ladder of initiation.
- **72 Shem guardians** — lunar decans cycling angels and daemons.
- **78 archetypes** — majors and minors woven as one continuum.
- **99 gates** — triple expansion of the spine into recursion.
- **144 lattice** — eighth Fibonacci square anchoring the Codex.
- **243 completion** — 3^5, cube of balance sealing the Cathedral.

These numbers are the project’s Fibonacci-coded DNA, ensuring every layer folds into a coherent spiral.

## Resolver Bridge (why)
To honor the Trinity linkage, `assets/js/resolve.js` offers a tiny, ND-safe bridge that asks the Cosmogenesis Learning Engine for the current worker guardian. The helper stays offline-ready by using a single on-demand fetch, giving each plaque optional context without disrupting the calm archive flow.
