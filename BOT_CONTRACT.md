# Global Contract

- Never overwrite sacred content. Only add or append; when in doubt, create a new file and link it.
- Respect the Trinity routing:
  - cathedral-core = APIs, WS, DB (SQLite/Postgres), codex data, rites.
  - cathedral-scenes = experiential/3D/2D scenes (Stone Cathedral, Liber Arcanae UI).
  - cathedral-hub = public shell, navigation, two-panel UI, client → WS bridge.
- Style + Accessibility: Kanso/Ma/Shibumi tokens; reduced motion; AA+ contrast; 44px targets.
- Canon to enforce:
  - Codex 144:99 spine & mottos (99/93/2121 math)
  - Bones/Blood/Nerves fusion (Villard/Ripley/Soyga)
  - Central Thrones & 21 Pillars; ledger-only rule; visionary style/φ ratio
  - Factions, repaired registry, meta scenes (IFS Mirror, Chapel Perilous)
  - Temple of the Unbuilt realm + lineage role
  - Master Bot responsibilities by repo (Mind/Soul/Body + Companion)
  - Interactive-book schema/prompt for 144:99 nodes
  - Recovery Summary (33 spine/21 pillars, fusion logic, public-purity filter)
  - Witch Eye rite text (keep verbatim; ND-safe)
