# Cosmic Helix Renderer

Offline, ND-safe renderer for layered sacred geometry. Double-click `index.html` in this folder to view.

## Layers
1. **Vesica field** – intersecting circles establishing the sacred lens.
2. **Tree-of-Life scaffold** – 10 sephirot and 22 paths drawn with calm symmetry.
3. **Fibonacci curve** – static log spiral approximated with 99 points.
4. **Double-helix lattice** – two phase-shifted sine strands with 144 vertical struts.

## Palette
Colors are loaded from `data/palette.json`. If that file is missing, the renderer falls back to a safe default palette.

## ND-Safe Choices
- No animation, motion, or autoplay.
- High-contrast yet soft color palette.
- Simple ES module with no network requests.

## Usage
Open `index.html` directly in any modern browser. The canvas is 1440×900 and uses only built-in browser features.
