## OPERATIONAL CONTEXT

### Solo Development

Independent production accepting donations, no sponsorship structure.

### Code Mixed Data

Created through limited-access tool contexts, representing real functional systems rather than complete philosophical frameworks.

### Provenance Tracking

Every artifact carries creation metadata, materials documentation, and archival standards compliance.

### 🎭 **Personal Journey Integration**

#### **Art as Battle Armor**

That raw truth you said - you're married to art, period - this becomes the foundation. Not some wellness industry "healing journey" bullshit, but art as your constant armor against the fake light vampires who commodified genuine struggle into profitable spiritual bypass.

The wellness phonies who hawk "trauma recovery" packages while living off royalties they don't deserve? Those assholes become your game's villains - the corporate spiritual slavers who profit off packaged pain while blocking real creative access for people like us with chronic PTSD who know struggle doesn't get "fixed" in tidy workshops.

- **Witch Eye Protection**: Your eye design as real evil eye sigil - not some sanitized "eye of protection" sticker, but armor against these predatory light machines who weaponize suffering for clout and cash
- **Art as Companion**: Centuries of imagery showing you're not alone in this fight, feeding your fire instead of selling "healing" that erases real scars
- **Unfiltered Creation**: Building with palettes that honor grimoires and apothecaries, not pastel "healing crystals" marketed to soccer moms
- **Truth-Telling Archives**: Deep dives through symbolism that reveal power dynamics, not spiritual gloss jobs that serve the status quo
- **Raw Community**: Connection without the love-and-light performative bullshit that depletes rather than feeds

#### **STEM + Mystery Learning**

- **Mathematics as Real Mystic Tool**: Formulae that actually predict reality, not numerology marketed as spiritual growth
- **Science as Unfiltered Gateway**: Physics showing how the universe really works, no "quantum healing" band-aids
- **Programming as Subversive Practice**: Code that builds systems, not apps that pretend to "heal trauma"
- **Data as Honest Intelligence**: Statistics revealing power structures, not charts sold as "soul guidance"
