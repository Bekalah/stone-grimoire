# üúç Stone Grimoire ‚Äî Integration Brief (Sponsor-grade / Team-ready)

**Scope:** Living Cathedral (Rosslyn pattern) with museum-quality style system, alchemy fusion engine, Shem Ladder, plaques, ND-friendly sound, and room routing.
**Goal:** Make it trivial to reuse this stack across other art/magick projects.

## 0) What‚Äôs in place (high level)

- **Style Wardrobe**: `stylepacks.json` + `style-engine.js` apply museum skins (palette/motif/optional texture) to any page/element.
- **Cathedral Engine**: auto-detects the current ‚Äúroom‚Äù, loads its element/tone/style, and starts the gentle overlay + audio pad on first tap.
- **Plaque System**: a curator card on every page (element glyph, tone, stylepack swatches, notes).
- **Angelic Data (72)**: full Shem ha-Mephorash mapping (sign, decan, ruler, element, stylepack, cymatic pattern, tone).
- **Alchemy Engine**: 7 operations (calcination‚Üícoagulation). Blends two archetypes: color glide, mid-blend style handoff, tone glide.
- **Labs/Pages**: Helix Totem (3D fusion), Shem Ladder (72 grid), chapel pages (Apprentice/Lady/Crypt), Musical Cubes stubs, PD Library stub.
- **Accessibility/ND-Friendly**: no strobe, sound gated on first gesture, high contrast skins possible, ARIA roles/labels.
