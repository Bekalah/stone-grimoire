# 📜 Stone Grimoire — Standards (Charter)

*“Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will.”* — A∴A∴  
We measure each work by **Intention + Technique** and its **Lineage**—and we preserve it with **Evidence** and **Reflection**.

This charter sets museum‑grade standards for art, text, ritual notes, and code published in **Stone Grimoire**. Public pages are **outer temple**; oath‑bound or personally identifying material remains **sealed**.

## 1) Canon of Practice

**1. Intention**  
A clear, concise statement of Will for the piece. *Why does this exist? What change is sought?*

**2. Technique**  
Method(s) used: medium, ritual form, algorithm, workflow. For AI‑assisted works, list model + prompt + seed (public‑safe).

**3. Lineage**  
Sources and correspondences (e.g., Agrippa, Soyga, Qabalah, Tarot; Thelema references via one‑reed.org; organizational info via oto‑usa.org). Indicate which are **Public Domain**, which are **commentary**, and what is **original**.

**4. Evidence**  
Artifact or link (image, plate, code, audio), brief process notes, and any reproducibility data.

**5. Reflection**  
What changed? What worked/failed? Safety notes (IFS/CPTSD awareness). No therapy content; seek professional care outside this archive.

## 2) Ethics & Boundaries

- **Public‑safe:** Publish only what may be shared; keep sealed names, sigils, oaths, and private gnosis **offline**.  
- **Consent & Privacy:** No doxxing or third‑party data. Use composites/anonymization in stories or case studies.  
- **Attribution:** Cite sources; prefer links to lawful scans for PD texts.  
- **Fair use:** Transformative commentary only; avoid long excerpts and logos from modern IPs.  
- **Safety:** Work IFS‑aware; pause if dysregulated. This archive is not therapy.
