# 📜 Stone Grimoire — Standards (Charter)

*“Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will.”* — A∴A∴  
We measure each work by **Intention + Technique** and its **Lineage**—and we preserve it with **Evidence** and **Reflection**.

This charter sets museum-grade standards for art, text, ritual notes, and code published in **Stone Grimoire**. Public pages are **outer temple**; oath-bound or personally identifying material remains **sealed**.

---

## 1) Canon of Practice

**1. Intention**  
A clear, concise statement of Will for the piece. *Why does this exist? What change is sought?*

**2. Technique**  
Method(s) used: medium, ritual form, algorithm, workflow. For AI-assisted works, list model + prompt + seed (public-safe).

**3. Lineage**  
Sources and correspondences (e.g., Agrippa, Soyga, Qabalah, Tarot; Thelema references via one-reed.org; organizational info via oto-usa.org). Indicate which are **Public Domain**, which are **commentary**, and what is **original**.

**4. Evidence**  
Artifact or link (image, plate, code, audio), brief process notes, and any reproducibility data.

**5. Reflection**  
What changed? What worked/failed? Safety notes (IFS/CPTSD awareness). No therapy content; seek professional care outside this archive.

---

## 2) Ethics & Boundaries

- **Public-safe:** Publish only what may be shared; keep sealed names, sigils, oaths, and private gnosis **offline**.  
- **Consent & Privacy:** No doxxing or third-party data. Use composites/anonymization in stories or case studies.  
- **Attribution:** Cite sources; prefer links to lawful scans for PD texts.  
- **Fair use:** Transformative commentary only; avoid long excerpts and logos from modern IPs.  
- **Safety:** Work IFS-aware; pause if dysregulated. This archive is not therapy.

---

## 3) AI Disclosure (when applicable)

Provide a brief **provenance block** for AI-assisted work:

AI Provenance
- Model: (which model you used — e.g. Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, GPT-5, etc.)
- Prompt (public-safe): "…" (a summary or safe form of your prompt)
- Seed: 123456 (the random seed if available — this lets others reproduce)
- Post: what editing you did after (Photoshop, Procreate, layout tweaks, etc.)
- Human role: what YOU did (composition, palette choice, curation, finishing touches)

  ---

## 4) Accessibility & Presentation

- **ALT text:** Each image needs meaningful ALT text (≥ 10 words).  
- **Contrast & readability:** High-contrast palette; serif body; sensible sizes.  
- **Captions & wall-text:** Provide a curator’s note under images/plates.  
- **Motion:** Avoid harsh animations; respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## 5) File & Folder Conventions

/folios/            # archival pages (Folio I, II…)
/standards/         # this charter, palettes, templates
/assets/img/        # images (web-sized; keep print masters offline)
/assets/css/        # optional shared stylesheet(s)
/assets/js/         # optional scripts
/backups/           # exported JSON or catalog snapshots (public-safe)

**Filenames:** kebab‑case, ASCII only.  
**Images:** keep web copies ≤ 3000 px on the long side; retain high‑res print masters offline.

---

## 6) Palette & Typography

**House palette:** *stone · gold · lapis*  

- Stone (dark): `#0f1216`  
- Stone (light/parchment): `#f8f5ef`  
- Gold: `#d4af37`  
- Lapis: `#2f5a9e`  

**Typography**  
- Body: classic serif (e.g., *Iowan Old Style*, *Georgia*)  
- Headlines: same family, bolder weight  
- Optional display: calligraphic or uncial font for initials / folio headings  

**Notes**  
- Keep contrast high for readability.  
- Use lapis for links and secondary headers.  
- Use gold sparingly, for emphasis (headings, dividers, illuminated initials).  
- Preserve a parchment aesthetic by combining the light stone background with serif body text.

## 7) Minimal Catalog Record (per piece)

Every Folio (or artifact) should include:

Title……: (Work title)
Date…..: YYYY-MM-DD
Realm…: (Assiah / Yetzirah / Briah / Atziluth)
Stage…: nigredo / albedo / citrinitas / rubedo
Angel…: (Shem guardian, public-safe)
Shadow.: (paired spirit, public-safe)
Glyph…: (letter/sigil, public-safe)
Intention:
Technique:
Lineage:
Evidence:
Reflection:
License: CC-BY-4.0 | CC-BY-SA-4.0 | CC0-1.0 | Public Domain | ARR(display only)
ALT text: (for primary image)

> Keep sealed names/sigils private. Use generic labels publicly (e.g., “Angel of 5°–10° Aries”).

---

## 8) Licensing

- **Code:** MIT (unless otherwise stated in a file header).  
- **Text & Images:** © You by default. Prefer **CC‑BY 4.0** for sharable essays/notes; use **ARR (display only)** for sensitive art or ritual plates.  
- **Public Domain Sources:** Clearly mark PD texts; link to lawful scans instead of re‑hosting full works when possible.  
- **Third‑party Materials:** Only include items you have rights to use (PD, your own work, or licensed). For commentary/quotations, keep excerpts short and transformative (fair use).

**Recommended footer per folio:**

License: CC‑BY 4.0 (text), ARR display‑only (images) unless noted.
Attribution: cites provided in “Lineage”.

## 10) Jacob’s Ladder / Double Tree Mapping (public-safe)

This archive acknowledges the **33-step spine** and the **Four Worlds**:

- **Briah (Creation)**: steps 17–24  
- **Atziluth (Emanation)**: steps 25–33  

Each step may list a **Shem angel / shadow pair** and a **Soyga/letter glyph** in public-safe form. Exact seals, calls, and ritual constraints are **not** published.

---

## 11) Citations & Further Reading (public)

- Hermetic Qabalah & Thelema overview: **one-reed.org**  
- Organizational references: **oto-usa.org**  
- Renaissance sources: Agrippa, *Three Books of Occult Philosophy* (Public Domain)
