🜍 circuitum99 — Cathedral Annex (Unified)

A living codex of art standards, chapel schematics, and archive references.
For use in Stone Grimoire / Codex 144:99 (museum-grade, ND-friendly).

⸻

I. Open Source Art Index (Approved Archive)

Purpose: All visual and symbolic resources used in the Codex must come from safe, public-domain, or explicitly licensed sources.
This guarantees museum-grade provenance, sponsor safety, and neurodivergent-safe alignment.

Categories:
 • ✦ PD Engravings → Fludd, Dürer, Ripley Scroll fragments.
 • ✦ Visionary Abstraction → Hilma af Klint, Emma Kunz (patterns + spirals).
 • ✦ Occult Geometry → Villard de Honnecourt sketchbook, Book of Soyga grids.
 • ✦ Sacred Textures → Rosslyn carvings, Gothic tracery, alchemical marginalia.
 • ✦ Color Archives → Munsell spectral wheels, medieval pigment studies.

Integration:
 • /docs/open_source_art_index.md holds the canonical list.
 • Each plaque or chapel page cites which archive entry it derives from.
 • Index is linked to the museum checklist for auditing.

II. Apprentice Pillar Chapel (Rosslyn Integration)

Page: /chapels/apprentice-pillar.html
Theme: Rosslyn’s Apprentice Pillar as a living ladder.
 • Geometry: Helix vine = Prima Materia ascent.
 • Numerology: Mapped to Jacob’s Ladder and the 33-vertebrae spine.
 • Hermetic Role: Entry point for the alchemical journey (Nigredo → Albedo → Citrinitas → Rubedo).
 • Plaque Note: “The Apprentice Pillar is not failure — it is the beginning. Its spiral holds the prima materia of all further ascent.”

Style:
 • Museum-grade parchment layout.
 • Hilma spiral overlays + subtle neon tracery.
 • ND-safe: high contrast skins available; tone gated on gesture.

III. Cathedral Code Annex

Document: /registry/Cathedral_Code_Annex.html
(Exported also as PDF for sponsor review.)

Function: Master annex connecting rooms, plaques, and schema.
 • Routes (structure.json) → index, cathedral, chapels.
 • Plaques (room-plaque.js) → glyphs, tones, lineage notes.
 • Stylepacks (stylepacks.json) → Hilma spiral, sun_solaris, druidic greenman.
 • Engines (cathedral-engine.js) → applies overlays, tones, curator voice.

Current Anchors:
 • Frontispiece → “Open the cosmogram.”
 • Nave → “Boaz | Apprentice | Jachin.”
 • Pillars (Boaz, Jachin) → Strength / Mercy.
 • Choir → “Jacob’s Ladder resonance.”
 • Codex Node → liber-codex99.md (fusion text).

Accessibility:
 • ND-safe sound → gated, gentle cathedral pad.
 • No strobe.
 • ARIA roles + narrated glyphs.
 • Cymatic blooms planned for non-hearing inclusion.

IV. Integration Summary
 • /docs/open_source_art_index.md → reference archive.
 • /chapels/apprentice-pillar.html → first chapel node, tied to Jacob’s Ladder.
 • /registry/Cathedral_Code_Annex.html → annex manifest, binding routes + plaques.

All three are now fused into one annex entry.

📍 Save this document as:
README_ANNEX.md in your repo root.

It gives your codebot one unified reference, with provenance, chapel detail, and system routing in place.

⸻

Do you want me to expand this annex into a template so every new chapel, pillar, or realm page automatically has:
 1. Museum checklist
 2. Plaque note
 3. Stylepack reference
 4. Provenance citat
