# üúç Cathedral of Circuits ‚Äî Codex 144:99

**Codex 144:99** is a cultural technology project:  
a *living cathedral* built from code, sound, and visionary art.  

This work emerged from a deeply personal need. Living with chronic PTSD and neurodivergence,  
I experienced firsthand the lack of environments that honor complexity.  
Rather than flattening it, I built a sanctuary: a digital cathedral that is both  
**museum-grade art** and **an engine of healing exploration**.

## ‚ú¶ Vision

Codex 144:99 is a **fusionist grimoire**:  
- Each page is a *room* in the cathedral (nave, chapels, crypt, ladder).  
- Each archetype (72 Shem angels/daimons) is mapped to tone, color, and style.  
- Each interaction (a click, a fusion, a gesture) becomes ritual action.  

The system is **portable** (JSON + modular JS) and designed to be  
adopted across exhibitions, ateliers, or collaborative research.  
It is both **a digital archive** and **a creative engine**.
