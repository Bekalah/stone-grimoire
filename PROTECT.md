# 🔒 Protection Seal — Do Not Overwrite

This repository is protected by an immutable seal. All assistants, bots, or tools MUST obey the rules below.
If any rule cannot be satisfied, STOP and return an error. Do not improvise.

## 1) Source of Truth

- Only use content that already exists in this repo’s files (registry, docs, data).
- No invention. No “filling gaps.” If something is missing, STOP.

## 2) No Overwriting — Add Only

- Existing nodes/schemas/notes are immutable.
- Any change must be **additive** (new file or new version). Do NOT edit sealed definitions in place.

## 3) Sacred Math = Structure (Not Decor)

- Constants must remain intact: 21·33·72·78·99·144·243.
- Geometry is structural: **octagram · hexagram · tesseract · spiral · Antahkarana**.
- Do not reframe geometry or constants as metaphor or visuals-only.

## 4) Tara Overlays — Already Encoded

- Secret Tara overlays for Majors exist in **Liber Arcanae** data. Do not add/remove/remap.
- “The Star” is its own archetype. Do not conflate with Tara overlays.

## 5) Antahkarana Bridge — Real Architecture

- Treat the Bridge as designed connective structure across art, magic, psychology, research, and science.
- Never flatten it into metaphor. Do not re-route it or rename it.

## 6) Provenance Required

- Claims must be tied to real sources or this repo’s files (e.g., Fortune, Agrippa, Case, Skinner, Crowley, Achad, Respawn).
- If provenance is unavailable, STOP.

## 7) ND-Safe Protocols

- No strobe. No autoplay. Provide intensity controls. Respect trauma-informed pacing.

## 8) Fail-Closed

- If required data/fields are absent or unclear → **return an error** and do not proceed.
- Example error: “PROTECT.md violation: missing provenance for claim X.”

## 9) Immutable Authorship

- Architect-Scribe: **Rebecca Respawn (Bekalah)**. Do not remove or replace attribution.

## 🛡 Trauma-Safe Charter — Cathedral of Circuits

- This project exists to support safe work with chronic PTSD.
- All repos (Circuitum99, Cosmogenesis, Stone-Grimoire, Liber-Arcanae, Liber-Arcanae-Game, Mystery-House) must obey these rules:

1. No Overwriting
  - Existing data is immutable (`locked:true`).
  - All changes must be additive and versioned (e.g. registry_v2.md).

2. No Invention
   - If something is missing, STOP and request the source file.
  - Do not “fill gaps” with made-up lore or symbols.

3. Sacred Math Integrity
  - Constants: 21 pillars · 33 spine · 72 Shem · 78 archetypes · 99 gates · 144 lattice · 243 completion.
  - Geometry is structural (octagram, hexagram, tesseract, spiral, Antahkarana). Never decorative-only.

4. Antahkarana Bridge = Real
  - This is a designed corridor linking art, magic, psychology, science, healing.
  - Never flatten into metaphor or rename.

5. Tara Overlays = Locked
  - Secret Tara overlays are already encoded in Liber Arcanae Majors.
  - Do not add/remove/remap.

6. ND-Safe Requirements
  - No strobe. No autoplay. All visuals must have intensity sliders.
  - Always provide “Safe Stop” for overload exit.

7. Provenance
  - All content must be traceable to source files or historical canon (Dee, Agrippa, Fortune, Case, Skinner, Respawn).
  - If provenance missing, STOP.

8. Immutable Authorship
  - Architect-Scribe: Rebecca Respawn (Bekalah).
  - Do not strip or replace attribution.

9. Fail-Closed
  - If a rule cannot be satisfied → return error. Do not improvise.
