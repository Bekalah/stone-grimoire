# Core — Cathedral of Circuits (Codex 144:99)

This folder holds repo-level documents and utilities that keep the cathedral healthy and consistent.

## Contents

- `index.html` — Core hub (links to Health Check, Dossier, Bridge docs).
- `health-check.html` — Quick verifier for JSON, pages, and engines.
- (Optional) `CONTRIBUTING.md` — How to add rooms/plaques safely.

## Rules

- Treat `assets/data/` as the single source of truth for JSON.
- All new rooms must be registered in `assets/data/structure.json`.
- Use ASCII characters only in code (avoid smart quotes/em-dashes).
- Provide a Curator Plaque for every new folio/room.
