# Witch Eye Covenant

A faction devoted to preserving visionary integrity and protecting exiled voices.

- Guardian of authenticity: [Aurex Nirvani](../characters/aurex_nirvani.md) ensures voices of the scapegoated are not erased.
- Presence acts as a daemon ward against false-light exploitation in plaques and chapters.
- Bridges to Sirens (music), Void Walkers (shadow), and internal Witch Eye vision keepers.
