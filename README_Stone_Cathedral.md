# README_Stone_Cathedral

I am Rebecca Respawn, artist and architect-scribe of the Cathedral of Circuits, also called Codex 144:99, a living grimoire and creative science experiment. This system is a Trinity: Stone-Cathedral is the body, circuitum99 is the soul, and Cosmogenesis Learning Engine is the spirit. Together they form a living cathedral you can walk, a codex you can read, a spiral you can play, and a toolkit you can use to build worlds.

Stone-Cathedral is the body. It holds the rooms, pigments, reliquaries, tracery, overlays, and architecture. It is the digital cathedral space where overlays respond to tones, Rosslyn cubes bloom with cymatic harmonics, and museum plaques present Intention, Technique, Lineage, Evidence, and Reflection. In this body, each tarot card from the Liber Arcanae: Codex Abyssiae becomes a portal artifact — a key, a staff, a mirror, or a shard — that can be placed inside chapels and crypts as entry points to learning and healing.

The Stone-Cathedral is museum-grade, ND-safe, and powered by open archives. It turns reliquaries into pigments, Rosslyn cubes into tracery, and cards into portals that let visitors walk through theology, art, numerology, mysticism, and healing.
