# ✦ PORTAL INTEGRATION

**Core Principle:** Every card = a **doorway** in the Cathedral of Circuits (Stone-Grimoire).  

- **Visuals[]** → Pigments, yantras, visionary fractals (Hilma af Klint, Carrington, Gonzalez).

- **Learning[]** → Ars Notoria mnemonics, Soyga ciphers, Codex laws.  
- **Game[]** → Realm trials, NPC daimons, faction artifacts.  
- **Artifact[]** → Staffs, Chalices, Coins, Blades; each coded to its card.  

**Crystal Reiki Mode:**  
- Spreads form **grids** in app space.  
- Each grid = overlays of crystal diagrams, Solfeggio harmonics, BioGeometry rays.  
- Generates ND-safe soundscapes, binaural rhythms, and color-shifts.  

**Unity Function:**  
- 72 Shem Angels + 72 Goetia Demons reconciled.  
- Consecration Angels (from Damien Echols’ Greater Hexagram rite) guard portals.
