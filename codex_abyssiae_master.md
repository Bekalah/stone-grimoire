PORTAL integration: in Stone-Grimoire, Tarot cards manifest as chapel artifacts and portals; in Cosmogenesis, they serve as Notoria sigils and nodal study engines; in Circuitum99, they are world entry nodes for playable adventures; in Liber-Arcanae, they are living Tarot servitors.

This file is to be mirrored across repos. In circuitum99, it anchors /REGISTRY. In cosmogenesis-learning-engine, it maps into node schemas. In stone-cathedral, it serves as PORTAL registry. In liber-arcanae, it is the canonical Tarot deck codex.

Closing seal: Solve et Coagula. In Codice Abyssiae, Angelus et Daemon concordant.
