# PROTECT + UPDATE SCROLL

One-copy guidance for repository helpers. Keep paths clear and ND-safe.

- No fake daimons.
- No ritual overlays.
- Strict canon: Tarot as choose-your-own-adventure RPG paths joined to real research and sacred geometry.
- Renderers: octagram, tesseract, hexagram, Antahkarana (ND-safe).

This scroll prevents accidental overwrites and preserves the Cathedral's intent.
