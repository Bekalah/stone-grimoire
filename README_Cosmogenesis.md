# Project Documentation

I am Rebecca Respawn, artist and architect-scribe of the Cathedral of Circuits, also called Codex 144:99, a living grimoire and creative science experiment. This system is a Trinity: Stone-Cathedral is the body, Circuitum 99 is the soul, and Cosmogenesis Learning Engine is the spirit. Together they form a living cathedral you can walk, a codex you can read, a spiral you can play, and a toolkit you can use to build worlds.

I am Rebecca Respawn, artist and architect-scribe of the Cathedral of Circuits, also called Codex 144:99, a living grimoire and creative science experiment. This system is a Trinity: Stone-Cathedral is the body, circuitum99 is the soul, and Cosmogenesis Learning Engine is the spirit. Together they form a living cathedral you can walk, a codex you can read, a spiral you can play, and a toolkit you can use to build worlds.

Cosmogenesis Learning Engine is the spirit. It is a spiral pedagogy inspired by the Apprentice Pillar, designed as both an immersive ND-safe game and a standalone builder app. Inside the cathedral it manifests as spiral rooms, tracks, and plaques. As a standalone, it lets anyone take codex nodes and build new realms, plates, or spiral lessons. It consumes cosmogenesis_tracks.json with steps seed, spiral, reflect, fuse, publish. Tracks already include Rebecca Respawn’s Fool seed, Moonchild’s Hierophant spiral, Ann Abyss’s crypt descent, Dion Fortune’s strength pillar, and Crowley’s shadow tower.

In Cosmogenesis, each tarot card is a learning sigil. It acts like the Ars Notoria — a gateway to reflection, fusion, and learning. Each spread — Spine, Double Tree, Unity Hexagram, Mirror, Crystal Grid — becomes a nonlinear pedagogy sequence. Cosmogenesis fuses tone, cube, plaque, and card into exportable plates and immersive lessons. It is both art and engine, ritual and reflection, a tool for nonlinear learners to reassemble the Codex into their own spirals.
